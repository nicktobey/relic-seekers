- # The Gameplay Loop
  
  Relic Seekers is a game themed around exploration, structured into **expeditions**. Players go on expeditions in order to find treasure, uncover secrets, acquire new tools and skills, and gain experience points.
  
  Every expedition consists of the following steps:
- ### 1. Players decide on a location to explore, and the Gate or Waypoint within that location where they want to begin their expedition.
  
  Some campaigns are focused around a single location, such as a megadungeon. Other, more open-world campaigns may give players more freedom to choose which location they explore next. (See “Running a West Marches Campaign”).
  
  If this is the first time that the players have traveled to this location, they will begin at that location’s Gate. However, locations may also have Waypoints, which are alternate starting points for the players. If the players have discovered a Waypoint on a previous expedition and activated it, they may choose to begin their expedition there instead.
- ### 2. Players choose their prepared items and traits.
  
  Each player looks through their character deck (See “The Character Deck”) and decides what Things (items and traits) they want to **prepare**, making them available during the expedition. They put these cards in front of them, next to their character sheet. Any Things not prepared remain in the character deck, and are treated as though they don’t exist until the next time the players make camp, whereupon each player can choose new Things to prepare.
- ### 3. The expedition begins 
  
  Players venture forth from their starting point and explore the location. They encounter challenges (including combat challenges, puzzle challenges, and skill challenges), and earn rewards (including experience points, new items, NPCs that can teach the characters new traits, money and other resources, etc). They may discover new Waypoints to serve as starting points for subsequent expeditions, or shortcuts that allow them to reach new areas from existing Waypoints.
- ### 4. The expedition ends
  
  An expedition usually ends in one of three ways: either the players complete their objective, they use a Gate or Waypoint to return to their base, or they fall in battle.
  
  Depending on the tone of the campaign, the consequences of falling in battle may vary. Some possibilities include:
	- The party is forcibly returned to their base.
	- The party is forcibly returned to their base, leaving some of their resources behind. A subsequent expedition may be used to recover these dropped resources.
	- The party is captured. Escaping capture (and recovering anything stolen from them) becomes their new objective.
	- The player characters are slain, and the players create new characters.
- No matter what, the GM should be upfront about the tone of the campaign, and what might happen should the players fall in the battle.
