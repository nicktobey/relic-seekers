- # Your Character
  
  In Relic Seekers, you track your character with both a character sheet and a character deck. Your character deck is used to track your character’s Things, which are cards that encompass abilities that your character has learned, as well as equipment they can use. Your character sheet tracks all other information, such as your character’s abilities scores, skill ranks, experience, money, and similar.
  
  You don’t need to use actual cards to represent your character deck. If you prefer, you can just list every Thing on your character sheet, along with relevant info (and the corresponding page number of the rulebook in case you need more details.)
- ## Ability Pools
	- See [[Ability Pools]]
- ## Skills
- Each player character has a set of skills (which represent things that the character is trained in) and a number of ranks in each of those skills. 
  
  Skills are used when making **Skill Checks**, the most common kind of roll. Every skill check is tied to a specific skill, and your number of ranks in that skill determines the number of dice that you roll. Sometimes you may have multiple skills that can be used for a skill check. In those cases, use the skill with the highest number of ranks (don’t add them.)
  
  Skills include (but are not limited to):
	- Weapon and armor proficiencies
	- Tool proficiencies
	- Categories of actions, such as “stealth” or “fire spells”
	- Areas of knowledge
	- Anything else you can think of, subject to GM approval.
- There is no total list of skills, but some are common enough to be listed on every character sheet.
- ## The Character Deck
  
  In Relic Seekers, your character traits and gear (collectively referred to as **Things**) are represented by a deck of cards. When you begin an expedition (and when you rest at a Gate or Waypoint), you choose which of these Things to **prepare**. Only prepared Things can be used. You can keep the other unprepared cards in your deck box: they're still a part of your character, and you can swap them out whenever you rest at a Gate or Waypoint.
  
  As you go on expeditions, you'll find new cards for your character deck:
	- When you level up, you may learn new traits according to your class.
	- Between expeditions you can buy any equipment with the “basic” tag.
- However, the main way to gain new cards for your character deck is through exploration. Within dungeons you may find:
	- Rare equipment that can't be bought in stores.
	- NPCs who can teach you new abilities
	- Items that grant you new abilities when used.
	- Books that allow you to choose new class abilities when you level up.
- Items (such as equipment) can be freely exchanged between players, but traits (such as abilities) can't. Once you add a trait card to your deck, you can't give it to someone else.
