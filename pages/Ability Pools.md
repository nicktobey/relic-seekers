- # Ability Pools
  
  Each player character has four ability pools: {{might Might}}, {{grace Grace}}, {{mind Mind}}, and {{will Will}}.
  
  Ability pools are a resource that are spent over the course of an adventuring day in order to succeed on difficult tasks or endure damage. Each time you take a **Long Rest**, your ability pools are restored to their maximum values. (The maximum value of an Ability Pool is sometimes called an Ability Score, and is recorded on your character sheet.)
  
  Each ability pool is physically represented by a collection of small objects, typically colored cubes of the ability pool’s associated color. Players always have a number of cubes in their play area equal to the corresponding ability score, but each of these cubes can be ***readied*** (placed on their character sheet), ***discarded*** (placed to the side of their character sheet), or ***vested to a Thing*** (placed on the card corresponding to that item or trait.)
  
  Ability pools typically deplete in one of three ways:
- Some actions or abilities may require you to spend from one or more your ability pools in order to use them.
- Every roll that a player makes is tied to an ability pool. When a player **Pushes Themselves**, they can spend from that ability pool in order to improve the outcome of the roll, or add an additional effect to a roll’s outcome.
- When a player makes a **Defensive Roll**, they spend from their pools in order to mitigate or prevent harmful effects.
  
  If a player doesn’t have enough points remaining in an ability pool, they may not be able to use abilities that require that pool, may not be able to push themselves on action rolls tied to that Ability Pool, and may not be able to use Defensive Rolls to prevent harmful effects.
- ## {{might "Might"}}
  
  A measure of your overall physical heartiness. Encompases strength and constitution. Represents your ability to sustain physical damage. Can be used for feats of athleticism, but is typically preserved, to keep oneself farther from death. 
  
  Equipping **Augmentations** typically requires vesting Might.
  
  Might is the ability pool most likely to be used to mitigate damage from attacks, and the least likely to be spent to activate abilities.
- ## {{grace Grace}}
  
  A measure of your stamina. Encompases dexterity and coordination. Represents your ability to dodge attacks. Used for acrobatic maneuvers.
  
  Equipping **Gear** typically requires vesting Grace.
  
  Grace, unlike the other ability pools, is easy come, easy go. Grace is the ability pool most likely to be spent to activate abilities (including attacking and dodging), but is also the easiest to restore during combat.
- ## {{mind Mind}}
  
  A measure of your mental focus. Encompasses intelligence and insight. Represents your ability to make sense of your surroundings. Used for arcane magic.
  
  Equipping **Spells**, **Maneuvers**, and **Recipes** typically requires vesting Mind.
  
  Mind is difficult to restore during combat once spent.
- ## {{will Will}}
  
  A measure of your force of personality. Encompasses your conviction, and your ability to believe in yourself or a higher power. Represents your ability to channel mystic energies and resist enchantment. Used for divine or innate magic, and for social encounters.
  
  Equipping **Relics** typically requires vesting Will.
  
  Will is difficult to restore during combat once spent.
