- *Long ago, when the stars were young, before our ancestors crawled out of the oceans, there were the Precursors. We don’t know what they looked like, or what language they spoke, but we know what they left behind: ruins filled with powerful Relics, and the interplanetary network of Gates that connect them.*
  
  *We are Seekers. We use the Gates to explore the universe, excavate their ruins, harness their Relics. One day, we will unravel the secrets of the Precursors and their sudden disappearance from the universe.*
- # What is Relic Seekers?
  
  Relic Seekers is a tabletop role-playing game with **exploration-based progression** inspired by video games like Metroid, Castevania, and Dark Souls. Relic Seekers features **tactical combat without using a grid**, and is designed for easy character creation across **a wide range of power levels**.
  
  Die rolls in Relic Seekers use a novel system where players spend resources from their **ability pools** in order to improve the result of their rolls. This allows every roll to be impactful and move the game forward, with better rolls reducing the cost of the action, or allowing for improved effect.
  
  The rule of thumb is that every die roll should do *something*, and the most common outcome is “success, at a cost.” This prevents players from feeling like they wasted an action, and prevents encounters from stagnating by always pushing them toward a conclusion.
- ## Exploration-Based Progression
  
  In Relic Seekers, exploration and character progression are closely intertwined. Exploring dungeons and discovering powerful relics is the primary method by which player characters gain new abilities. These abilities, in turn, are useful not just for combat but to unlock new areas for players to explore.
  
  Characters still gain experience and level up within their class, and many relics can be used to enhance or complement class abilities. This gives players freedom over their build and play style while still incentivising exploration and thematically connecting exploration and advancement.
- ## Tactical Combat Without a Grid
  
  All tactical combat in games is an abstraction: by eliminating the details that don’t matter, the game can focus on the details that do. Choosing the right level of abstraction is ultimately a matter of taste.
  
  Some games choose to model combat in a grid. This allows every player to know exactly where every character exists in relation to each other and their environment, at the cost of additional complexity and bookkeeping. Other games and some players prefer a “theater of the mind” approach, where positions and distances are somewhat ambiguous in order to limit unnecessary details and provide maximal narrative flexibility. In these systems, an attacker doesn’t need to know exactly how far away their target is, only whether the target is plausably in range.
  
  Relic Seekers takes a middle ground. A combat arena is divided into “zones”, which determines the ranges of attacks and effects. (For example, a simple melee attack requires that the target is in the same zone as the attacker.) But within a zone, the finer details of character positioning is a narrative tool rather than a mechanical one.
  
  Zones may often have their own abilities that affect combat: for instance, an archer on a balcony has an advantage against a target on the floor below, while an awning might provide cover against a similar attack. A bog might impede movement, while a floating platform is completely inaccessible to characters without flight (and poses a danger to anyone who gets pushed out of that zone.)
- ## Supports a Wide Range of Power Levels
  
  Characters in Relic Seekers have both a Tier and a Level, two different measures of player power that are often intertwined in other games:
- **Level** is a measure of a character’s experience and determines their strength and durability, as well as the breadth of their abilities.
- **Tier** is a measure of the “power scaling” of the campaign.
  
  When creating a campaign, the GM chooses the starting Tier of the player characters. For an “Epic Fantasy” story where the characters are akin to superheroes, the GM might choose a higher starting tier. For a “Gritty Fantasy” where character powers are more limited, the GM might choose a lower starting tier. Regardless of the chosen tier, players often begin at Level 1.
  
  This allows GMs to run “high-powered” campaigns as easily as low-powered campaigns, and allows players to create characters for any power level, with a similar amount of complexity and cognitive load for each tier.
- ### Why Separate Tier and Level?
  
  Many other games have a notion of “power tiers”, but these tiers are often just bands of levels. For example, D&D Fourth Edition has “Heroic Tier” (Levels 1-10), “Paragon Tier” (Levels 11-20), and “Epic Tier” (Levels 21-30.) This game keeps the notion of tiers of play while separating them from level. This gives the GM a simple dial they can use to control player power levels without complicating character creation or player advancement.
  
  Why is this useful? Oftentimes, GMs want a specific power level or feel for their campaign, such as low-powered “gritty fantasy”, or high-powered “epic fantasy.” But some systems assume a certain power level and have trouble accommodating games that operate at a different power level without tweaks.
  
  In other games, if a GM wants a higher-than-typical power level, they may opt to have characters start at a higher level. But higher level characters often aren’t just more powerful; they’re also more complicated and more time consuming to create. At worst, players may need to go through the process of leveling their character to the required starting level, making a whole campaign’s worth of choices right at the start.
  
  On the other hand, if a GM wants a lower-than-typical power level, they could choose to institute a level cap. But then players that hit that cap no longer get to improve their character or teach their characters new abilities, even if those new abilities would still be within the desired power tier. Some systems have a separate advancement system that kicks in once players hit the level cap, allowing them to translate additional XP into new skills. But those systems are balanced for the game’s max level, and GM’s may run into balance issues trying to make the system work at a lower level.
  
  Relic Seekers avoids this issue from the get-go by firmly separating Level Advancement (getting larger dice pools and learning new skills at your current power level) from Tier Advancement (gaining access to skills from a higher power level).
