- # Skill Checks
- Any time you're rolling dice to determine an outcome, you're making a skill check. Whether you're casting a spell, dodging an attack, scaling a difficult surface, or any other risky action, a skill check determines your level of success, and how much of your [[Ability Pools]] needs to be spent in order to achieve that success.
- Relic Seekers is asymmetrical: only the players roll dice, never the GM.
- Every skill check uses a single skill on your character sheet to determine the number of rolled dice, and usually lifts a single Ability Pool you can spend from in order to boost the result.
- When making a skill check, do the following steps in order:
	- ## Step 1: Roll the dice
	- Roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks that you have in the appropriate skill. Count the number of dice that show a 4 or higher. These are your Successes. Then, any dice that show a 6 “explode”: reroll those dice and count any additional successes from rerolled dice that show a 4 or higher. (If a die shows a 6 after the reroll, it “explodes” again: continue rerolling, counting the new successes each time, until no new 6s are rolled.)
	- In addition, you also roll two “fate dice”, which represent circumstances outside your control that may affect the check. Use a different color dice for these, or roll them after you’ve finished rolling (and exploding) the other dice. Add any successes from these dice.
	- Unlike normal dice, Fate Dice don’t explode. Instead, rolling double sixes or double ones on the Fate Dice represents a “Critical Success” and a “Critical Failure” respectively. (See “Critical Success and Critical Failure”, below.)
	- ## Step 2: Push Yourself
	- After rolling the dice, you can spend from one or more of your ability pools, you can improve the result of the check. A skill check will tell you what pools you can spend from in order to push yourself. For example, a “**Stealth (**{{grace Grace}}**)**” check can be pushed by spending {{grace Grace}}.
	- If a skill check lists multiple ability pools (such as “**Athletics (**{{might Might}}**,** {{grace Grace}}**)**” you can spend from either pool, or from a combination of both pools.
	- If a skill check lists **None** as its ability pool (such as “**Luck (None)**”, you can’t push yourself for that check.
	- For each cube that you discard from your character sheet, you can change the result of one die from a failure (3 or less, but not 1) to a success (4 or greater, but not 6).
	- Keep in mind the following when you push yourself:
		- Since it's not possible to change these dice to a 6, these dice cannot "explode".
		- Dice that rolled a 1 cannot be changed by pushing yourself.
		- The Fate Dice cannot be changed by pushing yourself.
	- ## Step 3: Spend Successes
	- Once you've counted up your successes, you get to spend them. The ability that instructed you to make a skill check will tell you how they can be spent.
	- In the simplest possible case, you're trying to generate a certain number of successes in order to cause a positive outcome or avoid a negative outcome. In these cases, the number of required successes is called the **difficulty** of the roll. For rolls against an enemy, the difficulty of the roll is typically the enemy’s level.
	- However, most checks also give you another way to spend successes. This way, even if the primary goal of the check failed, there's still a positive outcome.
	- Skill checks always advance the story or combat forward, even if they fail. Some abilities that instruct you to make a check will tell you what happens when the check fails. Other times, the GM may decide that failing a check means that you complete your task, but at some cost, or that your success was only partial.
